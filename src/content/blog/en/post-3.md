![Golden Visa UAE and Dubai real estate](/post-3.jpg)
*Path to 10-year residency for investors and family offices.*

**Quick orientation.** What to verify before transaction, where to apply and timeline from title deed to resident ID.

---

## 1. Investor Threshold: From 2M Dirhams — What Counts

**Minimum:** one property or sum of several ≥ 2,000,000 AED based on registered title deed or official valuation.

**Mortgage:** permitted with NOC from bank. Personal contribution requirements depend on emirate and property status:

- **Ready property (Dubai):** minimum down payment rule removed (2024), total value ≥ 2M dirhams matters
- **Off-plan (under construction):** typically requires 50% project completion + minimum 50% payment
- **Recommendation:** verify current requirements with DLD/Land Department before transaction

**Property:** ready, registered with DLD (Dubai) or Land Department of another emirate, suitable for occupancy.

### Not eligible:

- Leasehold without conversion to freehold (long-term land lease without ownership rights)
- Properties outside designated freehold zones (permitted areas for foreigners)
- Virtual transactions without registration

### Pre-deposit verification:

1. Request from developer/seller: title deed or valuation from independent approved valuer
2. If mortgage: verify bank's NOC issuance conditions after purchase and down payment requirements
3. Ensure property is in freehold zone (foreign ownership permitted area)
4. Confirm DLD/Land Department registration timeline (typically 1–3 business days after transaction)

---

## 2. Application Route: From Title Deed to Resident ID

### Dubai (DLD Investors Hub):

| Stage | Action | Document | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Property purchase | Title Deed ≥ 2M dirhams | Transaction day |
| 2 | Valuation (if needed) | Valuation Report | 2–5 days |
| 3 | Bank NOC (if mortgage) | No Objection Certificate | 3–7 days |
| 4 | Submit to DLD Investors Hub | Passport, title, health insurance | Online |
| 5 | Golden Visa approval | Entry Permit | 5–10 days |
| 6 | UAE entry and medical | Medical fitness | 1–2 days |
| 7 | Emirates ID application | Resident ID | 7–14 days |

**Other emirates (ICP Smart Services):**  
Similar process through emirate's Land Department → ICP → medical → ID.

**Timeline:** from purchase to ID in hand — 3–6 weeks with documents ready.

---

## 3. Family and Privileges: What Status Provides

### Sponsorship:

- Spouse and children included in your residency
- Sons: age and study/employment rules updated in 2024–2025 — verify current conditions on GDRFA/ICP
- Domestic staff: by quotas and categories (within current regulations)

### Business Ownership:

- Golden Visa holders can own 100% of mainland company (in permitted activities)
- License details: verify via DED/u.ae before registration
