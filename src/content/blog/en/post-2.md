*Holiday Home registration and building rules—the starting point before any calculations.*

**Quick orientation.** How to set up the regime, what to check in building rules, and how returns really add up across districts.

## 1. Set up the short-term regime (Holiday Home)

* In Dubai, short-term rentals operate via registering your **apartment as a Holiday Home** with the **Dubai Economy & Tourism (DET)**.
* The owner registers the unit and records guest data—essentially like a small hotel.
* If you manage **9+ units**, you'll need a professional **trade licence** with the activity for **Vacation/Holiday Homes**.
* Some buildings' Owners Associations **(OA/HOA)** restrict short-term stays or require approval. Before placing a deposit, request the **house rules / Residents Guide** from the community manager.

> **Important.** Not every building allows short-term rentals. Confirm the regime first—then run the numbers.

## 2. Districts: demand profile and entry ticket

**Business Bay.** Mix of business and leisure; **occupancy** stays relatively steady through the year.
**JVC.** Family trips; pronounced seasonality (winter stronger than summer).
**Dubai South.** Event-driven spikes around expos and trade fairs.

**Typical purchase ranges and working return corridors**

* **Business Bay:** studios ~**AED 750–850k**; 1BR from **~AED 1.2m**. Working net corridors seen in practice: studios **8–9%**, 1BR **7–8%**.
* **JVC:** studios ~**AED 550–650k**; 1BR **AED 850k–1.1m**. Corridors: studios **7–9%**, 1BR **6–8%**.
* **Dubai South:** studios ~**AED 400–500k**; 1BR **AED 650–800k**. Corridors: studios **5–8%**, 1BR **4–6%**.

*Note: ranges come from real deals and management reports; outcomes hinge on nightly rate and occupancy.*

## 3. One booking, full cost stack: where the money goes

* **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**
* **Platform fee**
* **Tourism Dirham** — fixed per occupied night under Holiday Home rules
* **Management fee** — often **15–25%** of revenue
* **Cleaning and consumables**
* **Interior wear & tear (amortisation)** — working guide **~10%** of gross per year

Math in one line—easy to copy:
`ADR − platform fee − Tourism Dirham − management (15–25%) − cleaning/consumables − amortisation (~10% of gross) = net`

## 4. Practical case: JVC studio ~AED 600k

**Owner's target:** gross **~AED 4,500/month**.
**Year-one reality:** summer **~2,800**, winter **~5,200**, plus a short maintenance pause. After fees/charges/management the net landed around **~6.5%** vs. the hoped-for "up to 9%".
**Takeaway:** pricing discipline, listing quality, and response time do the heavy lifting.

## 5. When short-term makes sense

* The unit is legally "clean": Holiday Home regime confirmed and **house rules** checked.
* Your **break-even** is modelled for rate and occupancy; you know the borderline months.
* You can commit **2–3 hours a week**: pricing, guest messages, cleaning schedule, and small fixes.

## 6. To-do before you buy

1. **Regime.** Before any deposit, obtain **house rules / Residents Guide** from the OA/manager and confirm Holiday Home is permitted for that building.
2. **Income model.** Build **Low / Base / High** scenarios for **ADR** and occupancy; include every item from the cost-stack above.
3. **Operations.** Decide between self-management or an **operator**. Lock service levels **(SLA)** for response time, cleaning standards, and listing (photos + copy).
