## How Do You Stress-Test the 50% Transition?

This is the most critical question for any sophisticated investor in Dubai today. While the 50/50 mortgage pivot is a powerful tool for capital velocity, it is not without its "red zones."

If you are planning to transition your off-plan installments to a bank, you must account for three **worst-case scenarios**:

### 1. The Valuation Trap

Banks finance the lower of the SPA price or the current market value. If the market dips at your 50% milestone, you must be ready to bridge the equity gap in cash.

### 2. The Rate Gap

Forward locks are non-existent for off-plan transitions. If construction delays coincide with rate hikes, your projected IRR can vanish.

### 3. The Construction Stall

If a project stops after the mortgage is activated, you are tied to a debt on a non-performing asset.
