    My story: Dubai real estate through personal experience
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-6">
    I'm Ivan Tyrtyshnyi, certified broker (DLD #48861), associated with Knightsbridge Properties.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Dubai became my home in 2014. Since then, I've traveled the path from investor with my own money to participant in UAE real estate litigation. Invested a six-figure dollar sum, lost — and got part of it back.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-8">
    This isn't advertising failures, but experience that can't be bought in any intensive or business course.
  </p>

  <hr class="mb-8" />

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why my experience saves clients years and money</h2>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Formats and trends change, but the value of personal story only grows. Everything that was "survival school" became a filter: I separate the essential from the noise, saving years for those who seek Dubai real estate and are used to thinking with their own heads.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-8">
    I work not for trends, but because I genuinely enjoy the process: researching, arguing, laughing at absurdity, and assembling scenarios for people who find templates boring.
  </p>

  <hr class="mb-8" />

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 mb-8 italic text-gray-700">
    <p class="mb-2"><strong>No copy-paste, no promises, no spam.</strong></p>
    <p>I work only with those who love asking questions, arguing, and being ironic. For the rest — the real estate market remains huge.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Your story is not a template: individual guidance</h2>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Instead of algorithms — a route built for a specific client request.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Each case has its own pace, its own rhythm, its own filter — and always a couple of my ironic comments included.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-8">
    I'm oriented toward long-term results, not quick deals. My task is for the client to feel confident both after the first deal and several years later.
  </p>

  <hr class="mb-8" />

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">AI in Dubai real estate work — not a trend, but a tool</h2>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Today artificial intelligence for me is not a fashionable accessory, but a natural filter.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-8">
    I completed training on Dubai Future Foundation's initiative: now AI is integrated into the work process. I search, filter, accelerate decision-making — I see what escapes manual search, shortening the distance between idea and result for clients investing in UAE real estate.
  </p>

  <hr class="mb-8" />

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Still too serious?</h2>

  <p class="mb-8 italic">
    In business, I've eaten more than one dog. Now I recommend taking falafel — it's easier to digest.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-16 italic">
    If all this seemed too serious — welcome to the first meeting: I don't promise magic, but I guarantee a good mood.
